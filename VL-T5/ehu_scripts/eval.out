You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Some weights of VLT5COMET were not initialized from the model checkpoint at t5-base and are newly initialized: ['encoder.visual_embedding.feat_embedding.0.weight', 'encoder.visual_embedding.feat_embedding.0.bias', 'encoder.visual_embedding.feat_embedding.1.weight', 'encoder.visual_embedding.absolute_vis_pos_embedding.0.weight', 'encoder.visual_embedding.absolute_vis_pos_embedding.0.bias', 'encoder.visual_embedding.absolute_vis_pos_embedding.1.weight', 'encoder.visual_embedding.obj_order_embedding.weight', 'encoder.visual_embedding.img_order_embedding.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Building Model at GPU 0
Some weights of VLT5COMET were not initialized from the model checkpoint at t5-base and are newly initialized: ['encoder.visual_embedding.feat_embedding.0.weight', 'encoder.visual_embedding.feat_embedding.0.bias', 'encoder.visual_embedding.feat_embedding.1.weight', 'encoder.visual_embedding.absolute_vis_pos_embedding.0.weight', 'encoder.visual_embedding.absolute_vis_pos_embedding.0.bias', 'encoder.visual_embedding.absolute_vis_pos_embedding.1.weight', 'encoder.visual_embedding.obj_order_embedding.weight', 'encoder.visual_embedding.img_order_embedding.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

It currently rounds toward 0 (like the 'trunc' function NOT 'floor'). This results in incorrect rounding for negative values.

You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
